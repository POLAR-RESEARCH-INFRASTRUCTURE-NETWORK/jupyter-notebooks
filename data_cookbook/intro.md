# POLARIN's Objectives

POLARIN is an international network of polar research infrastructures and their services aiming at addressing the scientific challenges of the polar regions.

POLARIN, funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme,  is an international network of polar research infrastructures and their services, aiming at addressing the scientific challenges of the polar regions. The network includes a wide array of complementary and interdisciplinary top level research infrastructures: Arctic and Antarctic research stations, research vessels and icebreakers operating at both poles, observatories, data infrastructures and ice and sediment core repositories.

POLARIN will provide integrated, challenge-driven, and combined access to these infrastructures to facilitate interdisciplinary research on complex processes.
POLARIN has the following six specific objectives, coherent with the work packages, each with measurable outcomes:

 - Enable science for understanding and predicting key processes in polar regions.
 - Provide efficient challenge-driven transnational access (TA) to top level RIs in the polar regions.
 - Improve data services and provide customised data products.
 - Provide virtual access (VA) to data and data services.
 - Provide training for infrastructure users.
 - Advertise RI services and engage RI users.
